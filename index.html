      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p>Currently based in New Orleans, but like to venture outdoors. I have the most amazing memories diving in the deep sea to backpacking in Nepal. I can't wait for my next adventure with my travel partner, my sister.</p>
      <h2 id="section-triathlon">Triathlon</h2>
      <p>All my extra time and energy is spent on the bike trainer or running outside. It all began when my sister had asked to go to Hawaii as a celebration to completing Nursing school... and doing 70.3 Hawaii. It was an amazing experience working through a routine and getting fitter during COVID. I was also fortunate enough to qualify to the 70.3 World Championships in St. George, Utah! That was an unforgettable experience with a battle against waves in the reservoir swim to hail on the bike. Thankfully, the sun was out and absolutely beautiful for the run. Right now, I am training for 70.3 Ironman Chattanooga on May 22, 2022.</p>
